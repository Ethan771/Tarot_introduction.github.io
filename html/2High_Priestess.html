    <h1>The High Priestess (Card II)</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The High Priestess is often depicted sitting between two pillars, one black and one white, representing duality and balance. She holds a scroll labeled "Tora," symbolizing divine law or wisdom, and wears a crown with a crescent moon, representing intuition and the unconscious mind. Behind her is a veil adorned with pomegranates, a symbol of fertility and the divine feminine. The veil separates the conscious and unconscious realms, indicating that she is the guardian of hidden knowledge. </p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the High Priestess appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies intuition, unconscious knowledge, and the need to look inward for answers. The card encourages you to trust your intuition and pay attention to your dreams and inner feelings. It's a card of mystery and hidden truths, urging you to tap into your inner wisdom. </p> 
        
    <p> Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the High Priestess can indicate ignored intuition, surface-level knowledge, or a lack of emotional or spiritual connection. It suggests that you may be ignoring your inner voice or failing to look beyond the obvious. It can also indicate that you're not being honest with yourself or others about your true feelings or intentions. </p>
        
    <p> In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the High Priestess serves as a reminder to trust your intuition and to look beyond the surface for answers. Whether you're facing a difficult decision or seeking a deeper understanding of a situation, this card encourages you to look inward and trust your inner wisdom. It's a card that often appears when you need to listen more closely to your inner voice and pay attention to any dreams, feelings, or hunches you may have.</p>
