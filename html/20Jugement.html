    <h1>Judgment (Card XX)</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Judgment card often depicts an angel, usually Archangel Gabriel, blowing a trumpet, symbolizing a call to resurrection or awakening. Below the angel, people are often shown rising from graves, reaching out towards the heavens, representing rebirth or judgment. The card is rich in symbolism related to renewal, evaluation, and transformation.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Judgment card appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies judgment, rebirth, and inner calling. The card encourages you to evaluate your past actions and experiences and to make judgments that will lead to new opportunities or transformations. It's a card of self-evaluation, often appearing when you're at a crossroads and need to make a significant decision.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Judgment card can indicate poor judgment, lack of self-awareness, or fear of change. It suggests that you may be making decisions without fully considering the consequences or that you're avoiding a necessary transformation.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Judgment card serves as a reminder to take stock of your actions and decisions and to prepare for a new phase in your life. Whether you're facing a significant life change, considering a new opportunity, or simply reflecting on your past, this card encourages you to make judgments that will lead to growth and transformation. It's a card that often appears when you're at a significant turning point in your life.</p>
