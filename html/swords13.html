    <h1>Queen of Swords</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Queen of Swords typically depicts a mature woman sitting on a throne, holding a sword upright in one hand. The sky behind her might be clear, suggesting clarity of thought, and the landscape often appears crisp and unobstructed. This imagery represents clear communication, independence, and unbiased judgment.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Queen of Swords appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies clear thinking, independence, and honesty.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Queen of Swords can indicate being overly critical, isolation, or miscommunication.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Queen of Swords often represents a person who values clarity, honesty, and direct communication. She is someone who can cut through confusion to see the heart of a matter. The card suggests approaching situations with a clear mind and being unafraid to speak the truth. When reversed, it serves as a reminder to ensure that clarity doesn't become coldness and that independence doesn't lead to isolation.</p>
