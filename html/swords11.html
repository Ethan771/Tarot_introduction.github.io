    <p>Symbolism:
        The Page of Swords often depicts a young figure standing on uneven ground, holding a sword upright. The sky behind might be filled with clouds or birds, and the wind might be blowing, suggesting change and unpredictability. This imagery represents curiosity, communication, and a thirst for knowledge.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Page of Swords appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies curiosity, new ideas, and communication.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Page of Swords can indicate gossip, hasty decisions, or a lack of direction.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Page of Swords often serves as a reflection of one's curiosity and desire to communicate or learn. It suggests a period of exploration, where new ideas are welcomed and conversations are stimulating. The card emphasizes the importance of being open-minded and vigilant. When reversed, it's a reminder to think before speaking, to avoid gossip, and to ensure that one's ideas are grounded in reality.</p>
