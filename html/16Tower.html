    <h1>The Tower (Card XVI)</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Tower card usually depicts a tall tower being struck by lightning, with flames erupting from the top and people falling from it. The imagery is dramatic and often unsettling, symbolizing sudden upheaval, destruction, and chaos. Despite its ominous appearance, the Tower card also carries the implication of necessary change and the breaking down of old structures to make way for new beginnings.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Tower card appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies sudden change, upheaval, and revelation. The card warns you to brace for impact, as a significant event or realization may shake the foundations of your life. It's a card of unexpected disruption, but also one that clears the way for new opportunities.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Tower card can indicate avoidance of disaster, fear of change, or a minor disruption. It suggests that you may be resisting necessary change or that the impact of an upheaval may be less severe than expected.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Tower card serves as a warning that a significant change or upheaval is on the horizon. Whether it's the end of a relationship, a sudden career change, or a personal revelation, this card encourages you to prepare for the unexpected. While the change may be disruptive, it often clears the way for new opportunities and growth. It's a card that frequently appears when you're about to experience a significant shift in your life.</p>
