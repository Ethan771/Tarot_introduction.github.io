Below the sun, there may be a child riding a horse, symbolizing innocence and freedom. Sunflowers or other vibrant flora often appear in the background, representing life and abundance. The overall atmosphere of the card is one of joy, vitality, and enlightenment.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Sun card appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies joy, success, and celebration. The card encourages you to be optimistic and to embrace the opportunities that come your way. It's a card of enlightenment, often appearing when you have gained a new understanding or have achieved a significant goal.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Sun card can indicate temporary setbacks, lack of clarity, or diminished joy. It suggests that you may be facing some challenges that are clouding your outlook or that you're not feeling as optimistic as usual.</p>

Whether you're celebrating an achievement, embarking on a new venture, or simply enjoying a period of happiness, this card encourages you to bask in the warmth and positivity around you.
