    <p>Symbolism:
        The Four of Wands typically depicts four wands standing upright, forming a structure similar to a canopy or a celebratory gateway. Beneath or between the wands, there might be garlands or flowers, suggesting a festive atmosphere. In the background, there are often figures celebrating or dancing, and a secure or prosperous-looking home or castle might be visible. This imagery represents celebration, harmony, and stability.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Four of Wands appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies celebration, joy, and stability.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Four of Wands can indicate conflicts, instability, or a lack of celebration.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Four of Wands often serves as a symbol of joyous occasions and stability. It suggests that it's a time for celebration, whether marking a special event or simply enjoying the harmony and stability in one's life. The card emphasizes the importance of recognizing and celebrating achievements, big or small. When reversed, it's a reminder to address any underlying issues that might be disrupting harmony or stability.</p>
