    <h1>Page of Cups</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Page of Cups typically depicts a young person standing by the water's edge, holding a cup from which a fish is emerging. The fish and the water symbolize the realm of emotions and the unconscious. The Page's attire is often flowing and adorned with images of waves or fish, further emphasizing the card's connection to emotions and intuition. The overall atmosphere of the card is one of dreaminess, sensitivity, and a touch of the unexpected.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Page of Cups appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies a new emotional beginning, heightened intuition, or a message related to the emotions. The card represents the exploratory phase of emotional development and can also indicate a person who is sensitive, dreamy, and intuitive.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Page of Cups can indicate emotional immaturity, missed intuitive messages, or being out of touch with one's emotions.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Page of Cups often serves as a reminder to trust your intuition and to be open to emotional experiences. Whether you're starting a new relationship, exploring your creative side, or simply tuning into your inner feelings, this card encourages you to embrace the journey with an open heart and a curious mind.</p>
