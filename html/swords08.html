    <h1>Eight of Swords</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Eight of Swords typically depicts a woman who is blindfolded and bound, surrounded by eight swords that are planted in the ground around her. In the background, there might be a castle or a body of water, suggesting isolation or emotional barriers. The imagery represents feeling trapped, restricted, or blinded to the truth.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Eight of Swords appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies restriction, self-imposed limitations, and feeling trapped.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Eight of Swords can indicate liberation, gaining clarity, or breaking free from limitations.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Eight of Swords often serves as a reminder that many of our perceived limitations are self-imposed. It suggests that one might be feeling trapped or restricted, but upon closer examination, there may be ways out that haven't been considered. The card emphasizes the importance of gaining clarity and not allowing fear or misconceptions to hold one back. When reversed, it's a sign of empowerment, suggesting that one is breaking free from limitations and seeing things more clearly.</p>
