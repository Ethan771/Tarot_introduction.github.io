<h1>The Lovers (Card VI)</h1>

<p>Symbolism:

    The Lovers card typically depicts two figures, often Adam and Eve or simply a man and a woman, standing beneath an angel or other celestial being. The figures may be surrounded by symbols of unity and duality, such as a tree of life and a tree of knowledge, or a sun and a moon. The angel often represents Archangel Raphael, the angel of healing, suggesting that love can be a healing force. </p>

<p>Upright Meaning:

    When the Lovers appear in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies choices, partnerships, and duality. While the card is most commonly associated with love and relationships, it also speaks to any form of partnership or choice that involves emotional investment.</p>

<p>Reversed Meaning:

    In its reversed position, the Lovers card can indicate imbalance, conflict, or the need to make a difficult decision. It suggests that you may be facing a dilemma where you have to choose between two different paths, neither of which aligns perfectly with your values. </p>

<p>In a Reading:

    In a Tarot reading, the Lovers card serves as a reminder to align your choices with your values and to consider the long-term implications of your decisions. Whether you're facing a romantic decision, an ethical dilemma, or any other choice that involves emotional investment, this card encourages you to weigh your options carefully and to seek harmony and balance. </p>
