    <h1>Six of Swords</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Six of Swords typically depicts a figure (often a woman and child) being ferried across a body of water by another figure. The boat contains six swords, pointing downwards. The water is usually calmer on the side they are heading towards, symbolizing a journey from turbulence to smoother waters. This imagery represents transition, moving on, and finding clarity after turmoil.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Six of Swords appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies transition, moving on, and a journey to a better place.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Six of Swords can indicate resistance to change, being stuck, or a journey with no clear direction.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Six of Swords often serves as a beacon of hope, suggesting that one is moving towards a better phase or situation. It emphasizes the importance of transitions, even if they are challenging, as they often lead to growth and clarity. The card also serves as a reminder that seeking guidance or help during tough times can be beneficial. When reversed, it's a nudge to re-evaluate one's path and ensure that one is moving in the right direction.</p>
