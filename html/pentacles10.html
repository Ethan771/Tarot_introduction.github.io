    <h1>Ten of Pentacles</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Ten of Pentacles typically depicts a multi-generational family gathered in a courtyard, surrounded by the arches of their estate, with a rich tapestry of pentacles above them. This imagery represents legacy, wealth, family, and long-term security.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Ten of Pentacles appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies wealth, legacy, and long-term security.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Ten of Pentacles can indicate family disputes, financial instability, or being overly focused on material wealth.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Ten of Pentacles often serves as a reminder of the importance of family, legacy, and long-term planning. It suggests that one has built or is in the process of building a lasting foundation for the future. The card emphasizes the value of connections, traditions, and the wealth (both material and emotional) that comes from strong family bonds and planning for the future.</p>
