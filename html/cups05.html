    <h1>Five of Cups</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Five of Cups typically depicts a figure draped in a black cloak, standing before three spilled cups, with two upright cups behind him. The spilled cups often contain wine or another liquid, symbolizing lost emotions or missed opportunities. In the background, there might be a bridge leading to a castle or home, suggesting a path forward. The card's imagery conveys a sense of loss, regret, and focusing on what has been lost rather than what remains.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Five of Cups appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies loss, regret, and disappointment. It can represent a period of mourning or sadness, but it also serves as a reminder to acknowledge and appreciate what remains.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Five of Cups can indicate acceptance, moving on, or a shift from regret to hope.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Five of Cups often serves as a reminder to process your feelings of loss or disappointment and to recognize the positive aspects or opportunities that remain. While it's natural to mourn losses and feel regret, this card encourages you to shift your focus from what's been lost to what still remains and the potential for future blessings.</p>
