    <h1>Seven of Wands</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Seven of Wands typically depicts a figure standing on higher ground, holding a wand and defending against six other wands that are being pointed towards him from below. This imagery represents defense, standing one's ground, and facing opposition.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Seven of Wands appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies defense, perseverance, and determination.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Seven of Wands can indicate giving up, feeling overwhelmed, or a lack of competition.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Seven of Wands often serves as a symbol of defense and determination. It suggests that one is in a position where they need to stand their ground and face challenges head-on. The card emphasizes the importance of perseverance and holding onto one's beliefs or position, even when faced with opposition. When reversed, it's a reminder to assess whether it's worth defending a position or if it's time to reconsider and possibly change course.</p>
