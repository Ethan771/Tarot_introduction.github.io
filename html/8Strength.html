    <h1>Strength (Card VIII)</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Strength card typically shows a woman calmly taming a lion, often by holding its jaws open or petting it. The lion represents our primal instincts, fears, or angers, while the woman symbolizes the 'higher self' or the power of the human spirit. The infinity symbol often appears above her head, similar to the Magician, indicating that this kind of strength is an eternal quality.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Strength card appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies courage, inner strength, and resilience. Unlike the Chariot, which represents external strength and willpower, the Strength card focuses on inner strength and the power of the human spirit to overcome any obstacle.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Strength card can indicate a lack of courage, inner strength, or self-control. It suggests that you may be letting your fears or impulses get the better of you, leading to a lack of self-discipline or a feeling of powerlessness. </p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Strength card serves as a reminder that you have the inner strength and courage to face whatever challenges come your way. Whether you're dealing with a difficult situation or struggling with your own fears or impulses, this card encourages you to tap into your inner reserves of strength and resilience. It's a card that often appears when you need a boost of courage or a reminder of your own inner power.</p>
