    <h1>Two of Wands</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Two of Wands typically depicts a figure standing between two upright wands, holding a small globe or wand in his hand and looking out over a vast landscape or sea. This imagery represents planning, future possibilities, and choices.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Two of Wands appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies planning, future ambitions, and decisions.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Two of Wands can indicate fear of the unknown, lack of planning, or being unprepared.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Two of Wands often serves as a reminder of the importance of planning and looking ahead. It suggests that one is at a crossroads, with the potential for growth and exploration. The card emphasizes the value of setting clear intentions and being open to new possibilities. When reversed, it's a nudge to ensure that one is prepared and has a clear direction before moving forward.</p>
