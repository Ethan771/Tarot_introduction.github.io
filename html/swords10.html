    <h1>Ten of Swords</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Ten of Swords typically depicts a figure lying face down with ten swords embedded in their back. The sky above might be dark, suggesting despair or the end of a difficult period, but often there's a hint of a new dawn or light on the horizon, indicating hope and a new beginning. This imagery represents betrayal, endings, and hitting rock bottom.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Ten of Swords appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies betrayal, endings, and a sense of being backstabbed.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Ten of Swords can indicate recovery, resisting finality, or fearing the worst.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Ten of Swords often serves as a stark reminder of the challenges and betrayals that can be faced in life. It suggests a difficult ending or a low point, but also emphasizes the potential for new beginnings and recovery. The card serves as a call to accept the realities of certain situations, to release what no longer serves, and to look forward to the new opportunities that arise from endings. When reversed, it can indicate a reluctance to let go or a fear of what's to come.</p>
