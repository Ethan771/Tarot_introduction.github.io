    <h1>Ten of Wands</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Ten of Wands typically depicts a figure struggling to carry a heavy burden of ten wands or staffs. The figure might appear hunched over, indicating the weight of the load, and is often shown walking towards a town or destination, suggesting a journey or goal. This imagery represents burden, responsibility, and being overextended.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Ten of Wands appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies taking on too much, burdens, and responsibilities.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Ten of Wands can indicate releasing burdens, delegating, or avoiding responsibilities.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Ten of Wands often serves as a reflection of the burdens and responsibilities one might be carrying. It suggests that one might be taking on too much and feeling weighed down as a result. The card emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's limits and considering whether it's time to delegate or let go of certain tasks. When reversed, it's a reminder to ensure that responsibilities are managed effectively and that one doesn't avoid necessary obligations.</p>
