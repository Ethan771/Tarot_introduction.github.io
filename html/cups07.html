    <h1>Seven of Cups</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Seven of Cups typically depicts a person standing before seven cups, each filled with different symbols, often floating on clouds. These symbols can include a castle, a snake, a dragon, a figure draped in cloth, a wreath, jewels, and a skull, among others. Each cup represents a different dream, illusion, or choice. The card's imagery conveys a sense of fantasy, confusion, and the allure of multiple options.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Seven of Cups appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies choices, illusions, and daydreaming. It can represent a period of indecision or being faced with many tempting options, some of which may not be as they seem.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Seven of Cups can indicate clarity, making a decision, or the dispelling of illusions.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Seven of Cups often serves as a reminder to be discerning when faced with multiple options and to differentiate between reality and fantasy. While it's natural to dream and imagine various possibilities, this card encourages you to ground yourself and carefully evaluate your choices before making a decision.</p>
