    <p>Symbolism:
        The Knight of Wands typically depicts a knight in armor, riding a spirited horse and holding a wand or staff. The background might show a desert or barren landscape, and the horse often appears ready to charge or leap forward. This imagery represents action, adventure, and impulsiveness.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Knight of Wands appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies action, adventure, and charisma.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Knight of Wands can indicate recklessness, haste, or lack of direction.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Knight of Wands often serves as a symbol of action and adventure. It suggests that one is charged with energy and ready to pursue their goals with passion. The card emphasizes the importance of seizing the moment and being bold in one's endeavors. However, it also serves as a reminder to ensure actions are well-thought-out and not overly impulsive. When reversed, it's a caution against acting too hastily or without a clear direction.</p>
