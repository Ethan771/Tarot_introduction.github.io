    <h1>Wheel of Fortune (Card X)</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Wheel of Fortune card often features a large wheel, sometimes surrounded by figures or animals that represent various cosmic and spiritual concepts. The wheel itself is usually inscribed with symbols, letters, or numbers that signify the complexities of fate and destiny. The wheel is often shown in motion, indicating that life is in a constant state of change. Above or around the wheel, there may be representations of different deities or archetypal figures that oversee the turning of the wheel.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Wheel of Fortune appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies fate, destiny, and cycles. The card suggests that events are turning in your favor or that a new cycle is beginning. It's a card of luck, opportunity, and a change in circumstances, often appearing when you least expect it.</p>
    
    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Wheel of Fortune can indicate bad luck, resistance to change, or cycles of negativity. It suggests that you may be experiencing a run of bad luck or finding it difficult to break out of a negative cycle.</p>
    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Wheel of Fortune serves as a reminder that life is full of ups and downs, and that change is a constant factor. Whether you're going through a difficult time or riding a wave of success, this card encourages you to remember that "this too shall pass." It's a card that often appears when you're about to enter a new phase of life or experience a significant event that could have a lasting impact.</p>
