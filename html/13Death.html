    <h1>Death (Card XIII)</h1>

    <p> Symbolism:

        The Death card often features a skeletal figure, sometimes riding a horse, and is usually accompanied by other figures that are either mourning or showing deference. The card may also feature symbols of the sun setting or rising, indicating the cyclical nature of life and death. Despite its ominous appearance, the Death card rarely signifies physical death; instead, it symbolizes transformation and change.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Death card appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies the end of a phase, transformation, and rebirth. The card encourages you to let go of outdated beliefs, relationships, or situations to make way for something new. It's a card of inevitable change and often appears when you're going through a significant transition.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Death card can indicate resistance to change, fear of endings, or being stuck in a destructive pattern. It suggests that you may be holding onto something that needs to be released, or that you're resisting a necessary transformation.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Death card serves as a reminder that change is a natural part of life and is often necessary for growth and transformation. Whether you're facing the end of a relationship, a career change, or a personal transformation, this card encourages you to embrace the change and see it as an opportunity for a new beginning. It's a card that often appears when you're on the brink of a significant life transition.</p>
