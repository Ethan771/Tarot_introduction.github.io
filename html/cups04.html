    <h1>Four of Cups</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Four of Cups typically depicts a person sitting under a tree, with three cups in front of them and a fourth cup being offered by a hand emerging from a cloud. The individual often appears contemplative or disinterested, seemingly unaware or uninterested in the cup being offered. The card's imagery suggests introspection, apathy, and missed opportunities.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Four of Cups appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies introspection, contemplation, and a sense of dissatisfaction. It can represent a period of self-reflection, but it can also indicate a tendency to overlook blessings or opportunities.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Four of Cups can indicate a new awareness, acceptance of an offer, or a shift from introspection to action.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Four of Cups often serves as a reminder to consider your emotional state and to be aware of the opportunities around you. Whether you're feeling introspective, apathetic, or simply contemplative, this card encourages you to evaluate your feelings and to be open to the blessings and opportunities that may be present.</p>
