    <h1>The World (Card XXI)</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The World card typically features a woman dancing inside an oval wreath or lemniscate (infinity symbol), surrounded by various figures or symbols that often represent the four elements—earth, air, fire, and water—or the four Evangelists—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The card is rich in symbolism related to completion, unity, and cosmic consciousness.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the World card appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies completion, fulfillment, and celebration. The card encourages you to recognize your achievements and to relish in the successful conclusion of a project or phase. It's a card of wholeness and unity, often appearing when you've reached a state of balance and understanding in your life.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the World card can indicate incompletion, lack of fulfillment, or disconnection. It suggests that you may be close to completing a significant phase but are not quite there yet, or that you're feeling disconnected from your achievements.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the World card serves as a symbol of completion and fulfillment. Whether you're wrapping up a long-term project, celebrating a milestone, or simply enjoying a period of contentment, this card encourages you to take a moment to appreciate how far you've come. It's a card that often appears when you're at a point of significant achievement or understanding.</p>
