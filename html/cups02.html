    <h1>Two of Cups</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

    The Two of Cups typically depicts two individuals facing each other, each holding a cup and often exchanging a caduceus (a staff with two snakes winding around it, often associated with commerce and negotiation) or a lion's head between them, symbolizing passion and power. Above them, there might be a winged lion or another symbol of unity and partnership. The card is rich in symbolism related to relationships, partnerships, and emotional bonds.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Two of Cups appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies partnership, mutual attraction, and connection. It can represent a romantic relationship, but it can also indicate a strong bond or partnership in other areas of life, such as business or friendship.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Two of Cups can indicate imbalance in a relationship, a breakdown in communication, or a temporary separation.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Two of Cups often serves as a positive sign for relationships and partnerships. Whether you're forming a new bond, deepening an existing relationship, or seeking harmony in a partnership, this card encourages you to nurture the connection and communicate openly. It's a card that often appears when there's a strong mutual attraction or when two parties are coming together in harmony.</p>
