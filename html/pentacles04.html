    <h1>Four of Pentacles</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Four of Pentacles often depicts a figure holding onto four coins (or pentacles) very tightly. The figure might be sitting on one coin, holding another close to his heart, and having the remaining two under his feet. This imagery emphasizes the themes of possession, control, and security. The card can also suggest being overly protective or miserly.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Four of Pentacles appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies a strong desire to hold onto things, especially material possessions or money.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Four of Pentacles can indicate letting go, being open to change, or a warning against being too materialistic.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Four of Pentacles often serves as a reminder to evaluate one's relationship with material possessions and money. It can suggest that while it's essential to seek security, one should not become overly possessive or resistant to change. It's a card that emphasizes the importance of balance between holding on and letting go.</p>
