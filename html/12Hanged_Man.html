    <h1>The Hanged Man (Card XII)</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Hanged Man is typically depicted as a man hanging upside-down from a T-shaped cross or tree, with his right leg crossed behind his left and his arms behind his back or folded across his chest. Despite his precarious position, his expression is often calm, even serene. The upside-down position suggests a different perspective or a suspension of action, and the card often features a glowing halo around the man's head, symbolizing enlightenment or a new understanding.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Hanged Man appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies sacrifice, surrender, and letting go. The card encourages you to pause and reflect, to give up your immediate desires for long-term gains, or to see things from a different perspective. It's a card of voluntary surrender and often appears when you're at a crossroads and need to let go of something to move forward.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Hanged Man can indicate stagnation, resistance to change, or a refusal to make necessary sacrifices. It suggests that you may be unwilling to let go of something that's holding you back, or that you're resisting the need to surrender or make a sacrifice.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Hanged Man serves as a reminder to take a step back and consider your situation from a different angle. Whether you're facing a difficult decision, feeling stuck, or contemplating a sacrifice, this card encourages you to pause and reflect before taking action. It's a card that often appears when you need to let go of control and trust that things will work out in the end.</p>
