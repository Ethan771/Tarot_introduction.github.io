    <h1>Justice (Card XI)</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Justice card typically features a figure, often a woman, seated between two pillars, similar to those seen in the High Priestess and the Hierophant cards. She holds a set of scales in one hand, symbolizing balance and fairness, and a sword in the other, representing rationality and the power to enforce her decisions. She is often blindfolded, indicating impartiality and the objective nature of justice.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Justice card appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies fairness, balance, and the law. The card encourages you to weigh all sides of an issue carefully before making a decision and to consider the consequences of your actions. It's a card of ethical choices and moral dilemmas, often appearing when you're seeking justice or are involved in a legal matter.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Justice card can indicate injustice, imbalance, or unfair treatment. It suggests that you may be involved in a situation where justice is not being served or where you're not being treated fairly.</p>
    
    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Justice card serves as a reminder to act with fairness and integrity, and to take responsibility for your actions. Whether you're facing a moral dilemma, a legal issue, or a difficult decision, this card encourages you to weigh all the options carefully and to act in accordance with your ethical beliefs. It's a card that often appears when you're seeking justice or are involved in legal matters.</p>
