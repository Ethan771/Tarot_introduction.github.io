    <h1>Eight of Cups</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Eight of Cups typically depicts a figure walking away from eight cups that are stacked or arranged in the foreground. The person is often shown moving towards a mountain or distant horizon, suggesting a journey or quest. The moon might be present in the sky, indicating a journey of introspection or the unknown. The card's imagery conveys a sense of departure, seeking deeper meaning, and leaving behind what no longer serves.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Eight of Cups appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies walking away, seeking deeper meaning, and introspection. It can represent a decision to leave behind a situation that no longer fulfills you or embarking on a personal quest for truth and deeper understanding.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Eight of Cups can indicate hesitation, fear of the unknown, or returning to a past situation.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Eight of Cups often serves as a reminder to follow your heart and intuition, even if it means leaving behind something familiar. Whether you're contemplating ending a relationship, changing careers, or embarking on a spiritual journey, this card encourages you to seek deeper meaning and fulfillment.</p>
