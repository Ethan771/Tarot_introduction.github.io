    <h1>Seven of Swords</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Seven of Swords often depicts a figure sneaking away from a camp or group, holding five swords with two other swords left behind. The figure's demeanor suggests stealth, cunning, or possibly deceit. This imagery represents strategy, deception, and taking matters into one's own hands.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Seven of Swords appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies strategy, deception, and acting on one's own.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Seven of Swords can indicate a change of strategy, being found out, or facing the consequences of one's actions.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Seven of Swords often serves as a cautionary card, suggesting that not everything is as it seems or that someone might be acting with ulterior motives. It's a reminder to be cautious, especially when dealing with situations that seem too good to be true or where full transparency is lacking. The card can also suggest the need for clever strategies or thinking outside the box. When reversed, it indicates a turning point where secrets come to light or a need to change direction.</p>
