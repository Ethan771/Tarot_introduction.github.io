    <h1>The Star (Card XVII)</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:

        The Star card typically features a woman kneeling at the edge of a body of water, pouring liquid from two jugsâ€”one into the water and the other onto the land. Above her, a large star is often surrounded by seven smaller stars, representing the chakras or the cosmic influence in our lives. The card is rich in symbolism of hope, inspiration, and divine guidance.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:

        When the Star card appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies hope, inspiration, and spiritual guidance. The card encourages you to remain optimistic and to trust that better times are coming. It's a card of healing and renewal, often appearing after a period of struggle or hardship.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:

        In its reversed position, the Star card can indicate despair, lack of faith, or missed opportunities. It suggests that you may be feeling hopeless or disconnected from your spiritual path.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:

        In a Tarot reading, the Star card serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration. Whether you're going through a difficult time or are on the brink of a new opportunity, this card encourages you to remain optimistic and to trust in the universe. It's a card that often appears when you're in need of spiritual guidance or are about to embark on a new phase in your life.</p>
