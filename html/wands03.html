    <h1>Three of Wands</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Three of Wands typically depicts a figure standing on a hill or elevated ground, looking out over a vast landscape or sea, with three wands standing upright around him. Ships might be seen in the distance, suggesting trade or journeys. This imagery represents foresight, expansion, and awaiting results.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Three of Wands appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies looking ahead, expansion, and anticipation.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Three of Wands can indicate delays, lack of foresight, or missed opportunities.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Three of Wands often serves as a symbol of anticipation and expansion. It suggests that one's efforts are starting to bear fruit, and it's a time of looking forward to the results. The card emphasizes the importance of preparation and being open to growth and new horizons. When reversed, it serves as a reminder to plan adequately and be patient, ensuring that one is ready to seize opportunities when they arise.</p>
