    <h1>Five of Pentacles</h1>

    <p>Symbolism:
        The Five of Pentacles typically depicts two individuals, often appearing destitute or in need, passing by a stained-glass window of a church or temple. The window usually has five pentacles on it. The imagery suggests themes of hardship, isolation, and external challenges, but also the potential for spiritual solace or assistance that might be overlooked.</p>

    <p>Upright Meaning:
        When the Five of Pentacles appears in a reading in its upright position, it often signifies financial hardship, challenges, or feelings of being left out in the cold.</p>

    <p>Reversed Meaning:
        In its reversed position, the Five of Pentacles can indicate recovery from hardship, finding support, or a change in one's circumstances for the better.</p>

    <p>In a Reading:
        In a Tarot reading, the Five of Pentacles often serves as a reminder that even in times of hardship, support and assistance can be found, sometimes in unexpected places. It emphasizes the importance of seeking help when needed and recognizing that challenges are often temporary. The card also suggests that spiritual or emotional support might be available, even if material challenges persist.</p>
